# End-End-HR-Anlytics Project

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of employee attendance data from April to June 2022, focusing on understanding Work From Home (WFH) and Work From Office (WFO) patterns. The goal was to derive actionable insights for better team activity planning and optimizing office space utilization.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI:** Used for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Microsoft Excel:** Utilized for initial data handling and cleaning.
- **Power Query:** Employed to consolidate and transform data from multiple sheets.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Created custom metrics for detailed analysis.

## Key Tasks & Techniques
- **Data Preparation:** Combined and cleaned data from different sources using Power Query. Automated repetitive tasks with a template function to improve efficiency.
- **Metrics Development:** Developed DAX measures to calculate critical metrics such as presence %, WFH %, and Sick Leave (SL) %, enabling detailed analysis of attendance trends.
- **Visualization:** Built an interactive dashboard in Power BI to display key metrics and insights visually.

## Key Insights
- **Declining Presence:** A noticeable decline in presence % over the three months, with a corresponding increase in WFH %, indicating a shift towards remote work.
- **Day-Specific Trends:** The highest presence was recorded on Mondays (93.21%), while Fridays had the highest WFH % (13.01%), suggesting a preference for remote work at the end of the week.
- **Actionable Recommendations:** Suggested scheduling team activities on Mondays to maximize participation, potentially leading to cost savings on office space and improved team engagement.

## Impact
The project provided valuable insights that could influence organizational strategies related to capacity planning, space utilization, and team-building activities.
